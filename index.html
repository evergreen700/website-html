        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a sophomore at BYU studying Bioinformatics! This is my second semester
          at BYU following my mission, which I served in Las Vegas! It may be dry here
          in Provo, but I'm grateful that it's not quite as dry and hot as Vegas was.
        <p>
          I enjoy reading, board games, hiking, skiing, and hanging out with friends.
        </p>

          I am from Hillsboro, Oregon. Hillsboro is about 15 minutes west of Portland,
          but I think it's still considered part of the Portland Metro Area. I was planning on doing
          an internship over the summer at OHSU (Oregon Health Science University in Portland) but
          I reached out to the wrong one by accident and now it looks like I'm going to Ohio State. Still
          excited though, never been to Ohio before.
